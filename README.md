# Camera-and-LIDAR-Fusion
I am working in the G.D Naidu Robotics Lab in VIT Vellore on creating an autonomous navigation stack for turtlebot 2 combined with sensor fusion technology to combine the data coming from LIDAR and RGBD camera to create a 3-D map with depth information. I used ROS and RVIZ for the map implementation.

## Introduction

### Turtlebot 2

This project is done in Linux operationg system version 16.04.6 LTS, and implemented on Turtlebot2 robot, ROS which is a middleware operating system in Kinetic version. Find below a hardware description of our Turtlebot2, equipped with a 2D RP LIDAR and a Kinect for depth sensing.
